  title: "Grafana Loki: 1 year later"
  description: "Loki is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It is designed to be very cost-effective and easy to operate, as it does not index the contents of the logs, but rather labels for each log stream. Since presenting Loki last year at DevOpsDays India 2018, lots of new and exciting features have been added to it including but not limited to live log tailing, LogQL, retention, pipelines and stages for scraping logs, docker driver etc. I will be talking about all the new features, performance optimizations, community support and what to expect in the future. I will also be demoing LogQL along with one of the most requested features, live log tailing."

  title: "Future of Observability"
  description: "The present and past of Observability has been centered around tools – Open source and ISV based. In the last decade, full stack observability moved from being a ‘nice-to-have’ use-case to a ‘must-have’. This changed the course of development and investments in building professional Observability platform. Plus, the observability moniker was born in the last two years out of traditional monitoring and service operations. Eventually, enterprises begun to realize that deploying production workloads without visibility into those workloads is analogous to ‘flying blind’. The future of observability is a bit dark (microservices and container orchestration further thwart the problem) and only the “meticulous ones” will succeed in setting up an intelligent and  efficient observability center. The word meticulous is key here because most modern, cloud-native companies are currently experiencing ballistic growth, and this means they don’t necessarily find the time to strategize and deploy a cogent observability practice. The future of observability is centered around planning and processes which I will dive into during the talk. Not surprisingly, the whole game is about to change. Next, there is a ground swell of open-sourced libraries and frameworks, plus first-grade professional platforms like New Relic, Splunk and Datadog. All of these technologies will require to work in harmony. "
