  title: "Grafana Loki: 1 year later"
  description: "Loki is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It is designed to be very cost-effective and easy to operate, as it does not index the contents of the logs, but rather labels for each log stream. Since presenting Loki last year at DevOpsDays India 2018, lots of new and exciting features have been added to it including but not limited to live log tailing, LogQL, retention, pipelines and stages for scraping logs, docker driver etc. I will be talking about all the new features, performance optimizations, community support and what to expect in the future. I will also be demoing LogQL along with one of the most requested features, live log tailing."

  title: "How to Package and Publish your Kubernetes Application as an Operator on OperatorHub"
  description: "Kubernetes declaratively manages a cluster by standardizing both resource definitions (Pod, Service etc.) and resource management logic (controllers). Using Operator pattern we can extent our Kubernetes cluster and manage our applications in a Kuberntes-native way. This enables us to embed operational knowledge as a combination of Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and custom controllers.
                The Operator-SDK Framework provides an efficient path for developers to adapt Kubernetes native experience for managing application deployments. It also provides effective tools to develop, test, package and publish Operators.
                My goal is to present end-to-end Operator development workflow consisting of writing an Operator, packaging and publishing on OperatorHub. I intend to start with a brief introduction to Kubernetes Operator pattern, Operator-SDK, Operator Lifecycle Manager and OperatorHub. Then demonstrate development, packaging, publishing and consumption of an operator on your Kubernetes/Openshift cluster."
